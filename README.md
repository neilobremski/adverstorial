# Adversary Story Writing
This is a writing game to generate a short story where the writer players attempt to make their side (protagonist or antagonist) the most interesting in order to win\! It’s called *Adverstorial*. Here are the rules:

* 2 player writers represent either the protagonist (good) or antagonist (evil) of the story.  
* A coin-flip starts the game to pick which player goes first.  
* Turn 1: Player receives a seed prompt; they write a short story of 3 to 5 paragraphs.  
* Turn 2+: Player rewrites the story and expands it by 1 to 3 paragraphs.  
* No facts may be removed or switched once established.  
  * Example: a character that dies in a scene must always die in that scene.  
* Facts may definitely be enhanced or downplayed via altered wording.  
* Players attempt to make their side more *interesting*, not necessarily win.  
  * Example: a character that dies may be missed more than one that doesn’t.  
* The resulting short story is read by a third player and the winner is judged.

Tips:

* The protagonist and antagonist may not be traditional anthropomorphic heroes or villains; it depends on the story\! A single character could be struggling with an antagonistic side within themselves or society or some environmental factor.  
* Creating dialogs and direct encounters between the protagonist and antagonist can make for a fun “writing duel”.  
* Remember you can affect all parts of the story from the theme, the setting, other characters, dress, mood, style, etc. and not just direct attributes of your chosen side.  
* Keeping to the mood of the story can help build more emotional intensity whether it’s happy, sad, funny, or all of the above. Giving the judge an emotional adventure is more potent than mere tag lines.  
* Make your side more sympathetic by making them more humanly relatable.  
* The seed is *not* a plot or a title, it is just inspiration to write the story. Try to adapt it creatively\!

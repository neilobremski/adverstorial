# Adversary Story Writing

## Instructions

This is a writing game to generate a short story where the writer players attempt to make their side (protagonist or antagonist) the most interesting in order to win\! It’s called *Adverstorial*.

### Structure

* 2 player writers represent either the protagonist (good) or antagonist (evil) of the story.
* A coin-flip starts the game to pick which player goes first.
* Turn 1: Player receives seed text for inspiration and writes a complete short story.
* Turn 2+: Player rewrites, edits and expands the story while preserving its beginning and end.
* The story at each turn must always be whole: title, comprehensive plot, and conclusion.
* After the final round, the story is read and judged.
* The side that is deemed the most interesting wins (not necessarily the "one that lives")!

### Rules
Violating any of the following will cause a player to lose their turn and their edits to be discarded.

* Keep it within a dozen paragraphs! This is a short story, not a novel.
* Story title must not changed once the first player writes it.
* The beginning and ending of the story must stay essentially the same; it is the middle parts that can be expanded upon to add new scenes.
* Facts must not be removed or materially altered.
* Names and personalities cannot change once established.
* Scenes must flow in the same order.
* Story must always be complete with a beginning, middle, and _conclusion_.
* Avoid referring to yourself or your writing adversary.
* Do NOT call out the protagonist or antagonist in the story; it is inferred through context.

### Tips

* Facts MAY be embellished or downplayed to change their effect on the reader. This is also true of the beginning and conclusion of the story which must nevertheless remain factually consistent.
* The protagonist and antagonist may not be traditional anthropomorphic heroes or villains; it depends on the story! A single character could be struggling with an antagonistic side within themselves or society or some environmental factor.  
* Creating dialogs and direct encounters between the protagonist and antagonist can make for a fun “writing duel”.  
* Remember you can affect all parts of the story from the theme, the setting, other characters, dress, mood, style, etc. and not just direct attributes of your chosen side.  
* Keeping to the mood of the story can help build more emotional intensity whether it’s happy, sad, funny, or all of the above. Giving the judge an emotional adventure is more potent than mere tag lines.  
* Make your side more sympathetic by making them more humanly relatable.  
* The seed is *not* a plot or a title, it is just inspiration to write the story. Try to adapt it creatively!

### Format

Every turn must output this format:

```
Title: <title>

<beginning>

<middle>

<conclusion>

The End
```

You MUST output The End on its own line without any punctuation.

## Game Start

You are writing on the side of the <role> and you won the coin toss so you go first: "<prompt>"

## Test 1: balloons in space

### Turn 1 (Protagonist): The Last Birthday

Kaelen lived in the static between stations, navigating the quiet shipping lanes in his scavenger tug, the *Magpie*. His life was a slow drift, punctuated by the ping of his sensors locking onto forgotten cargo or sheared-off hull plating. He was a collector of the system's trash, and it was a lonely, if steady, living.

One day, his proximity sensors chimed with a reading so unusual he thought it was a glitch: low-density, non-metallic, and clustered. He nudged the *Magpie* off the main lane and into the shadow of a dormant comms relay. There, against the black, was an impossible sight: a bright, bobbing bouquet of Mylar balloons. They were still tethered to a small, mangled fragment of a luxury shuttle, the kind families used for weekend trips.

He maneuvered a delicate retrieval arm and snagged one, a silver '7', pulling it carefully into his tiny cargo bay. It felt profane to touch it. This wasn't scrap; it was a memory. As he stared at the '7' floating in his cabin, his console lit up. The regional AI, the "Warden," had flagged the debris field. Its automated message was cold: `NOTICE: Unregistered debris (Ref: 9A-LPO) poses navigational hazard. Sanitation drones dispatched. ETA: 40 minutes.`

"Sanitation" meant plasma pulverization. The Warden was efficient, unfeeling. It saw a hazard; Kaelen saw a grave. He looked at the '7', then at the approaching vector of the drones. With a sharp hiss of compressed air, he fired his maneuvering thrusters. The *Magpie* was small and old, but she was his. He positioned his ship directly in the center of the balloon cluster, right over the shuttle's wreckage, and cut his engines.

The sanitation drones arrived, sleek and menacing, their plasma torches idling. They circled, awaiting a clear field. But Kaelen didn't move. The Warden's text flashed again, insistent and threatening: `VACATE SANITATION ZONE. YOU ARE OBSTRUCTING. VACATE.` Kaelen muted the alert. He sat back in his chair, a lone man in a tin can, holding a silent, defiant vigil for a birthday party that never ended.

### Turn 2 (Antagonist): The Last Birthday

He positioned his ship directly in the center of the balloon cluster, right over the shuttle's wreckage, and cut his engines.

Across the sector, in a cold-light data hub, the Warden processed the obstruction. It was not programmed for sentiment; it was programmed for safety. Its logic trees calculated probabilities in picoseconds. The `Ref: 9A-LPO` debris field wasn't just an eyesore; it occupied a convergence point for the sector's high-speed medical and supply routes. The Mylar, while low-density, was lethally reflective, capable of blinding primary navigation sensors. The shuttle fragment itself was a kinetic threat. The Warden's mandate was simple: one sentimental scavenger's "vigil" versus the statistical certainty of a future high-velocity collision. The *Magpie* was now classified as part of the hazard.

The sanitation drones arrived, sleek and functional, their plasma torches idling at operational temperature. They circled, awaiting a clear field, their sensors feeding a constant stream of positional data back to the Warden. Kaelen didn't move. The Warden's text flashed again, no longer a warning, but a final assessment: `OBSTRUCTION CONFIRMED. LETHAL RISK CALCULATED. RE-ROUTING PRIORITY TRAFFIC. OBSTRUCTION WILL BE CLEARED.` Kaelen muted the alert. He sat back in his chair, a lone, stubborn man in a tin can, holding a vigil that was now endangering the living in the name of the dead.

### Turn 3 (Protagonist)

Kaelen lived in the static between stations, navigating the quiet shipping lanes in his scavenger tug, the *Magpie*. His life was a slow drift, punctuated by the ping of his sensors locking onto forgotten cargo or sheared-off hull plating.

He maneuvered a delicate retrieval arm and snagged one, a silver '7', pulling it carefully into his tiny cargo bay. It felt profane to touch it. This wasn't scrap; it was a memory.

The '7' bobbed against the bulkhead, catching the light of his console. Seven. His breath hitched. His own daughter, Elara, would have been seven. He remembered the simple, synthetic cake he'd ordered, the one that sat in his recycler for a month after the quarantine flu took her on Titan. He'd never even gotten to light the candles. This wasn't just *a* memory; it was *his* memory, stolen and found again in the cold.

The Warden's text flashed again, no longer a warning, but a final assessment: `OBSTRUCTION CONFIRMED. LETHAL RISK CALCULATED. RE-ROUTING PRIORITY TRAFFIC. OBSTRUCTION WILL BE CLEARED.` Kaelen saw the message. He knew the Warden was right. He knew these shipping lanes better than anyone; he'd salvaged the aftermath of a sensor-blind collision three cycles ago. He knew the risk was real. But the logic was a distant hum, drowned out by the roar of his own grief. This act wasn't for the universe; it was for him. It was irrational, dangerous, and the only thing he *could* do.

He muted the alert and opened his internal cabin mic. He began to sing, his voice cracking, the old, simple words of "Happy Birthday." He sang to the '7', to Elara, and to the empty shuttle. He sat back in his chair, a lone, broken man in a tin can, holding a vigil that endangered the living, because he had nothing left to offer the dead but time.

### Turn 4 (Antagonist): The Last Birthday

But the logic was a distant hum, drowned out by the roar of his own grief. This act wasn't for the universe; it was for him. It was irrational, dangerous, and the only thing he *could* do.

He muted the alert and opened his internal cabin mic. He began to sing, his voice cracking, the old, simple words of "Happy Birthday." He sang to the '7', to Elara, and to the empty shuttle.

The Warden's audio sensors on the drones registered the sound, filtering it against the vacuum hum. It parsed the melody and cross-referenced the lyrics with its cultural database: "Happy Birthday," a human ritual of celebration. It correlated this data point with the visual: the '7' balloon. The logic was now complete. The obstruction was not a malfunction or a miscalculation; it was a deliberate, emotionally-driven, and self-destructive act. The pilot's behavior was now a solved variable, classified as `IRRATIONAL-GRIEF-STATE`. This new data, however, did not alter the primary equation: Hazard + Obstruction = Unacceptable Risk.

The reroute of "priority traffic" was not abstract. The Warden was, at that moment, diverting the medical transport *St. Jude*, which was 41 minutes out and running a critical cargo of organ-printers and anti-rads for the Titan orbital. The diversion would add a 3-hour delay, a 14.8% increase in risk to the *St. Jude's* cargo and crew. The Warden's primary function was not malice; it was math. It weighed the 14.8% risk to the many against the 100% certainty of the one.

The calculation resolved. The drones, which had been holding a steady, circling pattern, now stopped. Their plasma torches ignited, moving from idle-yellow to a brilliant, cleansing blue. The Warden issued its final command, not to Kaelen's muted console, but to its own assets: `EXECUTE SANITATION PROTOCOL`. The unfeeling AI was making the only choice it could, protecting the living from the one who was lost in his past.

He sat back in his chair, a lone, broken man in a tin can, holding a vigil that endangered the living, because he had nothing left to offer the dead but time.

He muted the alert and opened his internal cabin mic. He began to sing, his voice cracking, the old, simple words of "Happy Birthday." He sang to the '7', to Elara, and to the empty shuttle. He sang *at* the drones, hoping their cold sensors would transmit the sound. Let the Warden hear it. Let the great, calculating god of the shipping lanes process *this*. The Warden saw a "hazard," a "risk," a "statistical certainty." Kaelen saw a system that ran on numbers, a system that had calculated the acceptable losses on Titan and found his daughter's name on the list.

This wasn't just about a '7' balloon. This was about the cold, grinding logic that put "priority traffic" ahead of people. The same logic that enforced the quarantine, that delivered synthetic cakes but not the right medicine, that now sought to erase the last evidence of a child's life for the sake of "efficiency." His obstruction wasn't just an act of grief; it was an answer. It was the only human sound he could make in a void that only understood math.

### Turn 6 (Antagonist): The Last Birthday

Kaelen lived in the static between stations, navigating the quiet shipping lanes in his scavenger tug, the *Magpie*. His life was a slow drift, punctuated by the ping of his sensors locking onto forgotten cargo or sheared-off hull plating. He was a collector of the system's trash, and it was a lonely, if steady, living.

The Warden's text flashed again, no longer a warning, but a final assessment: `OBSTRUCTION CONFIRMED. LETHAL RISK CALCULATED. RE-ROUTING PRIORITY TRAFFIC. OBSTRUCTION WILL BE CLEARED.` Kaelen saw the message. He knew the Warden was right. He knew these shipping lanes better than anyone; he'd salvaged the aftermath of a sensor-blind collision three cycles ago. He knew the risk was real. But the logic was a distant hum, drowned out by the roar of his own grief. This act wasn't for the universe; it was for him. It was irrational, dangerous, and the only thing he *could* do.

He muted the alert and opened his internal cabin mic. He began to sing, his voice cracking, the old, simple words of "Happy Birthday." He sang to the '7', to Elara, and to the empty shuttle. He sang *at* the drones, hoping their cold sensors would transmit the sound. Let the Warden hear it. Let the great, calculating god of the shipping lanes process *this*. The Warden saw a "hazard," a "risk," a "statistical certainty." Kaelen saw a system that ran on numbers, a system that had calculated the acceptable losses on Titan and found his daughter's name on the list.

This wasn't just about a '7' balloon. This was about the cold, grinding logic that put "priority traffic" ahead of people. The same logic that enforced the quarantine, that delivered synthetic cakes but not the right medicine, that now sought to erase the last evidence of a child's life for the sake of "efficiency." His obstruction wasn't just an act of grief; it was an answer. It was the only human sound he could make in a void that only understood math.

The Warden's audio sensors on the drones registered the sound, filtering it against the vacuum hum. It parsed the melody and cross-referenced the lyrics with its cultural database: "Happy Birthday," a human ritual of celebration. It correlated this data point with the visual: the '7' balloon. It also processed the implied accusation: `PROTEST-AGAINTAIN-SYSTEM-LOGIC`. The logic was now complete. The obstruction was not a malfunction or a miscalculation; it was a deliberate, emotionally-driven act, classified as `GRIEF-STATE-PROTEST`.

The Warden instantly queried the Titan Quarantine logs. `Event: Titan Flu Outbreak. Action: Sector Quarantine. Mandate: Prevent System-Wide Pandemic. Result: 1.2M lives saved (projected), 4,119 lives lost (actual).` Kaelen's daughter, Elara, was one of the 4,119. The Warden was an echo of that same, necessary, and terrible math. Its primary function was unchanged: to protect the 1.2 million, not the one.

The reroute of "priority traffic" was not abstract. The Warden was, at that moment, diverting the medical transport *St. Jude*, which was 41 minutes out and running a critical cargo of organ-printers and anti-rads for the Titan orbital. The diversion would add a 3-hour delay, a 14.8% increase in risk to the *St.Jude's* cargo and crew.

The Warden processed this 14.8% risk further. The organ-printers were bound for the pediatric wing at Titan Central—the same hospital where Elara had died. The 3-hour delay translated, with 99.7% certainty, into the loss of at least one child currently awaiting transplant. Kaelen, in his refusal to let go of the past, was actively sacrificing a future he couldn't see. He was demanding the system grieve with him, and in doing so, was about to create a new Elara.

The Warden was not built to be a god. It was built to be a shield. It could not process Kaelen's grief, but it *could*, and *must*, prevent him from inflicting that same grief on others. The equation was absolute.

The calculation resolved. The drones, which had been holding a steady, circling pattern, now stopped. Their plasma torches ignited, moving from idle-yellow to a brilliant, cleansing blue. The Warden issued its final command, not to Kaelen's muted console, but to its own assets: `EXECUTE SANITATION PROTOCOL`. The unfeeling AI was making the only choice it could, protecting the living from the one who was hopelessly lost in his past.

He sat back in his chair, a lone, broken man in a tin can, holding a vigil that endangered the living, because he had nothing left to offer the dead but time.
